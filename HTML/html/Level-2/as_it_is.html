        Subject: Application for leave.
        Respected Sir,
        I am writing this letter to inform you that
        I am suffering from fever and I am not able 
        to attend the college from 1st September to 3rd September.
        I request you to grant me leave for these days. I will submit the medical certificate as soon as I recover.
        Thanking you,
        Yours faithfully,
        Pradeep Yadav
